										  <p>As part of my <b>Concurrent Network Application</b> module, the task was to create a chat client entirely in C# as well as incorporating a few other features and anything else we could think of.</br></br>
												My chat client uses both TCP and UDP protocols to send packets. These packets contain data such as a chat message, a user connected packet and many more. If reliabilitiy is needed, I would send a packet using TCP but otherwise UDP would be used.</br>
												 This was my first time using C# as well as my first time learning about networking.
												While I am fairly satisified with what I have right now, I had a few more features I would have liked to implement.</p>

											<p>As part of my <b>Further Games and Graphics Concept</b> module, my first assignment was to make a DirectX game engine whilst sticking to the OOP model.
											I implemented features such as a skybox, lighting system, texturing system as well as managing objects. </br>This was my first time using the DirectX api. It was quite confusing however due to my experience in OpenGL, it was not too difficult to grasp some of the concepts. Examples include, swap chain, devices and shaders</br></br>The game created using my engine did not match the expectations I had as most of my time was dedicated to adding features to the engine. </br> Nevertheless, this was my first engine made and I am happy with what I achieved so far.

My engine supported collision detection, tile maps, event management as well as audio support for wav files.</br> This was the first engine I have ever made and there were a large number of features which I wanted to add to it but I unfortunately ran out of time.</p>
