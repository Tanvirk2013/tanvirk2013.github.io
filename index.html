                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>13 years as a gamer and 5 years as a programmer. During my years at school, I used Scratch to make simple games and have been progressing on ever since I started my degree in Games Development at South and City College. During my time at college, I learnt about most of the roles in the games industry such as foley work, 3D modelling and level design but it was programming which I was infatuated with.</br>

                                <p>As part of my <b>Concurrent Network Application</b> module, the task was to create a chat client entirely in C# as well as incorporating a few other features and anything else we could think of.</br>
                                    My chat client uses both TCP and UDP protocols to send packets. These packets contain data such as a chat message, a user connected packet and many more. If reliabilitiy is needed, I would send a packet using TCP but otherwise UDP would be used.</br>
                                    This was my first time using C# as well as my first time learning about networking. While I am fairly satisified with what I have right now, I had a few more features I would have liked to implement.</br>

                                <p>As part of my <b>Further Games and Graphics Concept</b> module, my first assignment was to make a DirectX game engine whilst sticking to the OOP model. I implemented features such as a skybox, lighting system, texturing system as well as a way to manage objects. </br>This was my first time using the DirectX api. It was quite confusing however due to my experience in OpenGL, it was not too difficult to grasp some of the concepts. Examples include, swap chain, devices and shaders
                                    </br>The game created using my engine did not match the expectations I had as most of my time was dedicated to adding features to the engine. </br> Nevertheless, this was my first engine made and I am happy with what I achieved so far.

                                </br>We used Trello to make a scrum board and BitBucket for source control. The tasks I were given were, creating the tetrominoes as well as implementing the mechanics of tetris which included 'snap movement', row detection, and rotation.</p>

After brainstorming, our final idea was to make a wacky physics platformer set in space. My tasks as one of the programmers on the team was to create the movement for the player as well as create sound effects. This was my second time working in a group and my first game jam. I was impressed with what we made in this little time but unfortunately, the exported build was broken and we did not have time to fix it. The player moves too fast in the submitted build of the game.</b>

For both of my group projects, <b>Tetris</b> and <b>One Small Step</b> source control was used so that we were able to collaborate and by using branches, we could avoid overwriting each other's changes. </p>
